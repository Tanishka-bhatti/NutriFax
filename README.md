🍽️ Nutrifax — Food Nutrition Detector

Nutrifax is an AI-powered food recognition system that detects food items and provides their nutritional values (like calories, fats, proteins, carbs, etc.) just by taking a picture.
It’s a smart and convenient way to monitor your diet, track calories, and make healthier food choices in real time.
I used a kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/indian-food-images-dataset
for picture and another one for the nutrition values then simply combined it with the pictures using yolov8
